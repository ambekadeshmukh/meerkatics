- **Confidence Scoring**: Evaluate the model's level of certainty in its outputs.
- **Content Policy Compliance**: Ensure model outputs comply with defined content policies and guidelines.

### Real-World Example

**Legal Document Assistant**

A legal tech company used Meerkatics to monitor their document analysis tool that helps lawyers review contracts. Meerkatics' hallucination detection identified that when analyzing international contracts, the model would occasionally reference non-existent statutes or case law. These hallucinations would have been difficult to catch manually but could have had serious consequences if relied upon. The company implemented additional guardrails based on this insight and reduced hallucination rates by 94%.

## Performance Optimization

### Challenge

LLM applications need to be responsive and efficient to provide a good user experience, but identifying performance bottlenecks requires detailed monitoring.

### How Meerkatics Helps
