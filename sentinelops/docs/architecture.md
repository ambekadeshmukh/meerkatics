# SentinelOps Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the SentinelOps architecture, explaining its components, data flow, and design principles.

## Architecture Overview

SentinelOps uses a modern, cloud-native architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and extensibility. The system follows a microservices approach, with distinct components for data collection, processing, storage, analysis, and visualization.

## Core Components

### 1. Client SDK

The SentinelOps SDK is the entry point for monitoring data. It wraps LLM provider APIs to collect metrics, logs, and traces without requiring changes to application code.

**Key Features:**
- Minimal performance overhead (<10ms per request)
- Provider-specific wrappers for all major LLM providers
- Automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks
- Configurable batching and sampling
- Local buffering for resilience against network issues

**Language Support:**
- Python (primary)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (beta)
- Java (coming soon)
- Go (coming soon)

### 2. Data Collection Layer

This layer receives telemetry data from the SDK and prepares it for processing.

**Components:**
- **API Gateway**: Authenticates and validates incoming data
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Receives and processes telemetry data
- **Kafka Message Queue**: Provides reliable, scalable message delivery

**Data Types Collected:**
- Request metrics (latency, tokens, costs)
- Request/response payloads (when enabled)
- Error events
- System metrics

### 3. Stream Processing Layer

The stream processing layer analyzes data in real-time to provide immediate insights.

**Components:**
- **Stream Processor**: Analyzes and enriches data streams
- **Anomaly Detector**: Identifies unusual patterns in metrics
- **Hallucination Detector**: Evaluates LLM outputs for potential hallucinations
- **Cost Calculator**: Computes and attributes costs based on usage

**Processing Capabilities:**
- Real-time metric aggregation
- Pattern recognition
- Trend analysis
- Alerting conditions evaluation

### 4. Storage Layer

The storage layer retains metrics, logs, and metadata for querying and analysis.

**Components:**
- **Time-Series Database (Prometheus)**: Stores metrics data
- **Object Storage (MinIO/S3)**: Stores request/response payloads
- **Metadata Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores request metadata, configurations, and relationships
- **Search Index (Optional)**: Enables full-text search of request/response content

**Data Management:**
- Configurable retention periods
- Automatic data tiering
- Compression and optimization

### 5. Analysis and API Layer

This layer provides access to the collected data through APIs and performs deeper analysis.

**Components:**
- **API Server**: Provides RESTful and GraphQL interfaces
- **Query Engine**: Translates API requests into efficient database queries
- **Analysis Engine**: Performs advanced analytics on collected data
- **Export Service**: Generates reports and exports data

**Analysis Capabilities:**
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Usage pattern analysis
- Quality evaluation

### 6. Visualization Layer

The visualization layer presents insights through dashboards and alerts.

**Components:**
- **Dashboard UI**: Web-based interface for exploring monitoring data
- **Grafana Integration**: Custom Grafana dashboards for visualization
- **Alert Manager**: Manages alert rules and notifications
- **Report Generator**: Creates scheduled reports

**Visualization Features:**
- Interactive dashboards
- Custom charts and visualizations
- Filtering and drill-down capabilities
- Shareable reports

## Data Flow

### 1. Instrumentation and Collection

1. The SDK wraps LLM API calls in the client application
2. On each request, the SDK:
   - Records start time
   - Captures request parameters
   - Forwards the request to the LLM provider
   - Captures the response and completion time
   - Calculates metrics (tokens, latency, etc.)
   - Batches and sends telemetry data to the collection endpoint

### 2. Data Processing

1. The API Gateway authenticates the request and validates the data
2. The data is published to Kafka topics based on type
3. Stream processors consume the data and perform:
   - Enrichment (adding metadata, calculating derived metrics)
   - Anomaly detection
   - Aggregation
   - Alerting condition checks

### 3. Storage and Indexing

1. Processed metrics are stored in the time-series database
2. Request metadata is stored in PostgreSQL
3. Full request/response payloads (if enabled) are stored in object storage
4. Relationships between entities are indexed for efficient querying

### 4. Querying and Analysis

1. The API server receives queries from the dashboard or external systems
2. The query engine translates requests into optimized database queries
3. Results are processed, formatted, and returned

### 5. Visualization and Alerting

1. The dashboard UI requests data through the API
2. Charts and visualizations are rendered based on the data
3. Alerts are triggered based on defined conditions
4. Notifications are sent via configured channels

## Deployment Models

SentinelOps supports multiple deployment models to fit different needs:

### 1. Minimal Deployment

- Single-node deployment with all components
- Suitable for development and testing
- Deployed via Docker Compose
- Minimal resource requirements

### 2. Standard Deployment

- Multi-node deployment with basic scalability
- Suitable for small to medium production environments
- Deployed via Kubernetes
- Moderate resource requirements

### 3. Enterprise Deployment

- Fully distributed deployment with high availability
- Suitable for large production environments
- Deployed via Kubernetes with Helm charts
- Configurable resource allocation

### 4. Hybrid Deployment

- Core components on-premises with cloud storage
- Balances security and scalability
- Deployed via Kubernetes or custom infrastructure
- Flexible resource allocation

## Scaling Considerations

SentinelOps is designed to scale both vertically and horizontally:

### Vertical Scaling

- Prometheus can handle millions of time series with sufficient memory
- PostgreSQL can scale to handle thousands of queries per second
- Stream processors can utilize multiple cores for parallel processing

### Horizontal Scaling

- Multiple API Gateway instances for request distribution
- Kafka partitioning for parallel message processing
- PostgreSQL read replicas for query scaling
- Distributed Prometheus for large-scale metric collection

## Security Architecture

Security is a core consideration in the SentinelOps architecture:

### Data Security

- All data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- All communication encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+
- PII detection and redaction capabilities
- Configurable data retention policies

### Access Control

- Role-based access control for all components
- Fine-grained permissions for API endpoints
- API key management with rotation
- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2/OIDC integration for enterprise SSO

### Network Security

- Private networking for internal components
- Configurable network policies
- Support for VPC integration
- Service mesh compatibility

### Audit and Compliance

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Change tracking for configurations
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

## High Availability and Resilience

SentinelOps is designed for high availability:

### Redundancy

- Stateless components can run multiple replicas
- Stateful components support clustering and replication
- No single points of failure in production deployments

### Resilience

- Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
- SDK includes local buffering for network issues
- Automated recovery for many failure scenarios

### Disaster Recovery
